## Overview
This is the main repository for the rewrite of Dimensional Doors by StevenRS11. This repository contains the up-to-date code base and commits submitted.

## Discord Server
For the main bits, we have a Discord server made specifically for talking about Dimensional Doors. It's also the place where the devs meet to discuss current progress on certain aspects, and get feedback from the team.

You can report any bugs you find on [the issues page](https://github.com/DimensionalDevelopment/DimDoors/issues). Please include the following information:

To contribute a translation, start by copying the [en_US.lang file](https://github.com/DimensionalDevelopment/DimDoors/blob/1.12-WIP/src/main/resources/assets/dimdoors/lang/en_US.lang) to a text editor, and saving it as the [correct locale code](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Language#Available_languages). Translate **only what is to the right of the = sign**, and then click "Create a new file" on [this page](https://github.com/DimensionalDevelopment/DimDoors/tree/1.12-WIP/src/main/resources/assets/dimdoors/lang) to submit your translation.
